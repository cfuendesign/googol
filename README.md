# googol
A recreation of Google.com's main page rocking a dark theme

It took me about two hours to finish this, but it was a very nice practice. I was able to take note of a lot of the practices that Google does. I could conclude that there are lots of things that the main page does that are either product of accumulating half-butted fixes, the best workarounds available and/or just weird stuff related to the tracking/libraries they're implementing.
